R-MDPC
Herein, a Fast Main Density Peak Clustering Within Relevant Regions Via A Robust Decision Graph (R-MDPC) is proposed. R-MDPC assigns points within the relevant regions to avoid the association of irrelevant points. With the removal of regional differences and the attenuation of satellite peaks, a robust decision graph is obtained. Moreover, based on the kNN distance of data points, R-MDPC is believed to be suitable for large-scale data.
